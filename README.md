# Spoken Health Questionnaire for Blood Donation

## Overview
This is a Next.js-based application designed to assist individuals who cannot read Thai or are visually impaired by providing a spoken health questionnaire before blood donation. The app plays back health-related questions in both English and Thai, allowing users to listen and respond accordingly.

## Features
- Spoken health questionnaire for blood donation
- Display messages from a JSON file
- Scrollable message list with auto-scroll to the active message
- Play/pause audio associated with each message
- Navigate between messages with next/previous buttons
- Toggle between English and Thai language messages
- Render HTML content within messages safely

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js** (React Framework)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **TypeScript** (for type safety)
- **Dompurify** (for sanitizing HTML content in messages)
